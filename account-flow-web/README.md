## Warning
While testing the system, please do not refresh the screen, as there is no backend system to organize the data in the cart. To go back or go to another page, press the button that appears on the screen. When you press the cart icon, you will be taken to the cart page where the items are added. The back button will return you to the store page.

## assumption
I think the discount amount should not exceed the total amount, for example, the total amount is 100 but the discount is 200, when calculated, the total amount should be 0, the discount is 100.
